CLN_cbb_to_PEST,"It reads a clncbb file (when extracting the cbb from the separate CLNs), and reads the CLN pumps (WEL), so that they can be read by PEST. It is easily changeable to be able to extract another BC. ",Documentos\CLN_cbb_to_PEST
get_prop.py,"It reads the external property files (e.g., ._kx), and transforms them into an array.",Documentos\get_prop.py
syntetic_pp_3d,"It reads the external property files (e.g.: ._kx), and modifies them, reducing the property in depth, according to a decrease factor (in how many meters of depth it changes an order of magnitude). The degrowth factors are read externally, as well as the definition of each UH and the cumulative thickness of each unit. It assumes the same number of nodes per layer. ",Documentos\syntetic_pp_3d
syntetic_pp_3d_tot,"Same as above, but considers the cumulative sum of thicknesses (total depth) over each node to generate the reduction.",Documentos\syntetic_pp_3d_tot
Extract_props_2matrix,"It reads the external property files (e.g., ._kx), and transforms them into an array. This can be related in QGis to a mesh with Layer 1 numbering. Assumes the same number of nodes per layer",Documentos\Extract_props_2matrix
process_results_zb,"Processes the results of a Zone Budget obtained with zonbudusg.exe, in the csv2 format",Documentos\process_results_zb
get_head_data,"It obtains the heads of all SPs saved in the .hds for several specific nodes (which can be associated with wells) through an external file, and exports them in MACHI format (Well/Date/Value)",Documentos\get_head_data
read_cbb,"It reads different components of a .cbb, for certain specific nodes. It provides the basic structure to understand how to read a .cbb through Flopy.",Documentos\read_cbb
fix_porosity,"When running Modflow with transport, the porosity should always be greater than the SY. This script fixes ._po (external porosity) files, so that this is always true (if they are created separately with plproc, it might not always be true).",Documentos\fix_porosity
clean_par,Deletes all files with the .par extension of a folder. Easily generalizable to any type of extension. ,Documentos\clean_par
surface2UHG,"If you don't have Leapfrog, but you have surfaces that define different UHGs (raster), this script can take position from an XYZ file, and assign properties to it based on those elevations.",Documentos\surface2UHG
change_elevation,"A script made to be able to connect cells within the same layer. You can read elevations from a .dis or external file, or start with specific thicknesses per layer. It assumes the same number of nodes per layer. Be careful with areas of greater refinement, since in these areas it tends to connect better, due to little variation in elevations",Documentos\change_elevation
stop_wel_by_SP,Reads .wel file and assigns pumping equal to 0 to all wells operating between SP_in and SP_fin,Documentos\stop_wel_by_SP
file_directory,"Starting from a base folder, scrape the files and find all the files with the defined extensions, and then write the entire directory for each of the files",Documentos\file_directory
reduced_rei,"From a .rei file and a list of observations, reduce the rei file by selecting only those desired observations",Documentos\reduced_rei
lst2csv,"From the output modflow.lst, it extracts the balance information as requested in the names_sel_TLS file",Documentos\lst2csv
Mat2List,"Converts an array into a list, based on the name of the first row, and the value of the first column",Documentos\Mat2List
build_drn_pkg,"It reads the node-based information from the build_drain.xslx file and then constructs a .drn package. Allows conductance modifications over time, provides warnings and allows differentiations by zone",Documentos\build_drn_pkg
build_drn_pkg_v2,Reads the node-based information from the build_drain.csv file and then constructs a .drn package,Documentos\build_drn_pkg_v2
Cambiar_Conductancias_DRN,Modify an already created .drn from the nodes_drain.csv file. This allows the conductivity of the nodes to be changed in nodes_drain over time.,Documentos\Cambiar_Conductancias_DRN
model2vtu2,"This script aims to generate a vtu file for the 3D representation of a hydrogeological system
Numerical model in modflow.
It has the ability to represent unstructured meshes. 
By reading the gsf, lpf, bas, dis, hds and con packets you can assign results from models and
3D file properties. 
The output can be opened through Paraview",Documentos\model2vtu2
